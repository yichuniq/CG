# Computer Graphics - Transformation
## Goals
- Render a floor under the current model.
- Interact with the model using keyboard and mouse.
- Control the camera.
- Implement the geometrical, viewing and projection matrices.
  - Geometrical transformation – translation, scaling, and rotation
  - Projection – parallel and perspective projection
  - OpenGL transformation APIs are not allowed
- Switch model with a smooth transition.
## TODO
- Add control instructions
- Add demo/results
